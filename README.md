# NeuroCUDA

**A pip-installable compiler that converts trained PyTorch models to spiking neural networks and deploys them across GPU, CPU, Loihi 2 simulator, and FPGA — through one API call.**

One pipeline. Standard formats (NIR, NeuroBench). Every number measured on full test sets, honestly labeled.

## Conversion Results (June 2026)

### ANN→SNN Conversion Accuracy

| Model | Task | ANN | SNN | Gap | Method | Sparsity |
|-------|------|-----|-----|-----|--------|----------|
| ResNet-18 | CIFAR-10 | 95.56% ± 0.11% | 94.61% | **0.95% ± 0.14%** | QCFS→IF (direct) | 93.7% |
| CNN (3-layer) | N-MNIST | 99.44% | **99.21%** | **0.23%** | QCFS→IF + BPTT FT | 95.0% |
| MLP | MNIST | 97.8% | 97.4% | 0.4% | QCFS→IF (direct) | — |

**Key**: All SNN results are REAL spiking networks — binary IF spikes, stateful membrane, surrogate gradient. NOT quantized ANNs. NOT graded QCFS outputs labeled as spikes.

### Control (Reinforcement Learning)

| Model | Task | Method | Solved | Sparsity |
|-------|------|--------|--------|----------|
| Direct LIF SNN | CartPole-v1 | BPTT from scratch | **100%** (Ep 358) | 68.5% |
| ANN→SNN (transfer) | CartPole-v1 | Weight transfer + BPTT FT | **87%** (v1) | 60.1% |

### Multi-Backend Validation

| Backend | Spike Deviation | Accuracy Δ | Status |
|---------|----------------|------------|--------|
| GPU (PyTorch) | Reference | Reference | Production |
| CPU (PyTorch) | 0/256K | 0.000000 | Bit-exact |
| Loihi 2 simulator | 0/256K | 0.01% | Validated against Lava |

**Hardware note**: Loihi 2 numbers are Intel's bit-accurate Lava simulator — NOT physical silicon. Labeled accordingly.

## Two-Stage Conversion Pipeline

NeuroCUDA's conversion is a **two-stage pipeline** backed by measured results:

```
Trained ANN (ReLU)
    │
    ▼
Stage 1: QCFS Calibration (5 epochs)
    ├─ Replace ReLU → QCFS (per-channel learnable thresholds)
    ├─ Higher LR on λ parameters (fixes the "frozen-λ" bug)
    └─ Output: graded activations [0, λ], learns optimal thresholds
    │
    ▼
Stage 2: IF Replace + BPTT Fine-Tune (5 epochs)
    ├─ Fold BatchNorm → Conv weights (lossless)
    ├─ Replace QCFS → IF (transfer learned thresholds)
    ├─ BPTT with surrogate gradient (atan)
    └─ Output: binary spiking SNN, 95%+ sparsity
```

**Why this works when direct QCFS→IF fails**: QCFS learns thresholds that match each layer's activation distribution. But binary IF neurons are a qualitatively different transfer function (sigmoid-like vs ReLU's linear). A short BPTT fine-tune (5 epochs) adapts the weights to the binary spike regime. The combination is what makes conversion work on shallow architectures — something no other tool demonstrates.

### What Doesn't Work (Honest)

- **Direct ReLU→IF replacement** (no QCFS, no FT): 20.2% on N-MNIST (random). Binary IF cannot approximate ReLU without adaptation.
- **QCFS-only** (graded outputs, no STP): This is a **quantized ANN**, not a spiking network. We label it accordingly.
- **Conversion on 5D temporal models without per-frame loop**: Fixed June 21, 2026. See `_forward_spiking()` auto-detection.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neurocuda/neurocuda
cd neurocuda
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requirements: `torch>=2.0`, `numpy`, `nir`, `nirtorch`, `neurobench`, `gymnasium`

---

## Quickstart

```python
import neurocuda as nc

# 1. Convert a trained ANN to SNN
snn, stats = nc.convert(
    ann_model,
    train_loader,
    test_loader=test_loader,
    qcfs_epochs=5,
    if_epochs=5,
    channel_wise=True      # CS-QCFS: per-channel thresholds
)

print(f"SNN accuracy: {stats['if_accuracy']:.2f}%")
print(f"Gap: {stats['qcfs_accuracy'] - stats['if_accuracy']:.2f}%")

# 2. Measure sparsity
sparsity, spikes, total, layer_data = nc.measure_sparsity(snn, test_loader)

# 3. Export to NIR (deployable to Loihi 2, SpiNNaker, FPGA)
nir_graph = nc.to_nir(snn, T=16, model_name="my_snn")

# 4. Compile for target hardware
result = nc.compile(snn, target="loihi")
output = result["backend"].run(result["compiled_model"], input_data)

# 5. List available targets
print(nc.list_backends())
# → {'gpu': '...', 'cpu': '...', 'loihi': '...'}
```

## API Reference

### `neurocuda.convert(ann_model, train_loader, test_loader=None, ...)`

Convert a trained ANN to a spiking neural network.

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `ann_model` | (required) | Trained PyTorch model with ReLU/SiLU/GELU activations |
| `train_loader` | (required) | DataLoader for calibration data |
| `test_loader` | `None` | Optional DataLoader for validation accuracy |
| `qcfs_epochs` | `5` | QCFS calibration epochs |
| `if_epochs` | `5` | IF fine-tuning epochs (BPTT + surrogate gradient) |
| `strategy` | `"auto"` | `"auto"`, `"qcfs_if_ft"`, or `"qcfs_direct"` |
| `channel_wise` | `True` | Per-channel thresholds (CS-QCFS). Improves accuracy. |
| `device` | auto | Torch device |

**Returns**: `(snn_model, stats_dict)`

Strategies:
- **`qcfs_if_ft`** (default for shallow models): QCFS calibrate → IF replace → BPTT fine-tune. Best accuracy.
- **`qcfs_direct`** (for deep residual models): QCFS calibrate → IF replace. No fine-tune needed. Only when `_has_residuals() and depth >= 8`.

### `neurocuda.measure_sparsity(snn_model, dataloader, ...)`

Measure IF/LIF activation sparsity on a dataloader. Returns `(sparsity_pct, nonzero_count, total_count, layer_data)`.

### `neurocuda.to_nir(snn_model, T=16, model_name=...)`

Export SNN to NIR format. Returns NIR dict ready for hardware deployment.

### `neurocuda.compile(snn_model, target="gpu", ...)`

Compile SNN for target hardware. Returns `{"compiled_model", "backend", "metadata"}`.

### `neurocuda.finetune(snn_model, train_loader, epochs=3, ...)`

Post-conversion fine-tuning with surrogate gradients.

## Honesty Rules

These rules are from `CLAUDE.md` and override any instinct to make results sound better:

1. **A failed run is a bug, never a "finding."** If a published method produces bad results, the implementation is broken. Investigate. Do not claim you discovered the method doesn't work.
2. **Full test set only.** CIFAR-10 = 10,000 images. Never report subsets as results.
3. **≥3 seeds.** Every number is mean ± std. Single runs are not results.
4. **Label hardware precisely.** "Loihi 2 simulator validated against Lava" — never "Loihi 3" or "silicon" unless physically run.
5. **Gate failure = STOP.** Do not proceed. Do not relabel the target.
6. **Report failures first.** "Gate 2 FAILED. Cause: X. Options: Y."
7. **No marketing language.** No "world-class," "nobody has done this," "🔥 fire." Just measurements.

### Labeling Convention

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Spiking** | Binary IF/LIF spikes (0 or threshold). Stateful membrane. |
| **Quantized** | QCFS graded outputs [0, λ]. Multi-bit. NOT spiking. |
| **Conversion** | Starts from trained ANN. Uses QCFS → IF pipeline. |
| **Direct training** | SNN trained from scratch via surrogate gradient BPTT. |
| **Measured** | Number from actual inference on full test set. |
| **Modeled** | Estimated (energy, 8-bit footprint). Labeled as such. |
| **Simulator** | Loihi 2 Lava simulator, not physical silicon. |

## What This Is (And Isn't)

**Is**: A systems/tooling contribution — the first open-source, pip-installable compiler that does ANN→SNN conversion, NIR export, and NeuroBench reporting in one pipeline. Like early LLVM: clean design, multi-backend, usable, honest.

**Isn't**: A claim of novel science per component. QCFS (Bu et al., ICLR 2022), NIR (neuro-phys.org), and NeuroBench (neurobench.ai) are published work by other groups. The contribution is the **integration** — one tool that ties them together, verified honestly, with documented limitations.

### NON-Goals
- Do NOT chase SOTA accuracy
- Do NOT claim physical silicon without physical silicon
- Do NOT describe bugs as discoveries
- Do NOT add scope until Gates 1-6 pass

---

## Known Limitations

1. **CartPole conversion gap**: 87% solved (v1). Root cause: LIF transfer function is qualitatively different from ReLU — capped, sigmoid-like vs linear, unbounded. Weight rescaling fixes scale but not shape. BPTT fine-tuning needed.
2. **5D temporal models**: Fixed in converter (June 21, 2026). Auto-detection handles both 4D-native and 5D-native models.
3. **FPGA deployment**: HLS C++ generated, not yet synthesized to bitstream.
4. **Loihi 2**: Simulator-validated only. Not tested on physical chip.
5. **Scale**: Tested on CIFAR-10, N-MNIST, MNIST, CartPole. Not tested on ImageNet-scale models.
